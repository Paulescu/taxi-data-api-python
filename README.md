## Our goal 🎯

Let’s build a REST API that can serve data on historical taxi rides in NYC. The original data is stored in one-month parquet files [on this website](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page), and our goal is to make it easily accessible through a REST API.


## How to run this thing locally

Install [Python Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) if you haven't yet and then

- Build and run the dockerized REST API
    ```
    $ make all
    ```

- Send a sample request
    ```
    $ make sample-request
    ```
Boom.
